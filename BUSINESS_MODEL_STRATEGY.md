## 3. Recommended Model: Hybrid Commission + Subscription

## 6. Marketing Investment & ROI

### 6.1 Understanding Your Marketing Position

As platform owner, you're investing capital in:
1. **Student Acquisition**: Advertising to find students
2. **Tutor Recruitment**: Attracting quality tutors
3. **Brand Building**: Creating trust in the platform

This investment is justified because:
- You provide the marketplace infrastructure
- You handle technology, support, and quality assurance
- You take the risk of building the platform

### 6.2 Marketing Budget Allocation

| Channel | % of Budget | Target | Expected CAC |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **Facebook/Instagram Ads** | 40% | Students | Rs 50-100/signup |
| **Google Ads (Search)** | 20% | Students actively searching | Rs 80-150/signup |
| **WhatsApp Marketing** | 15% | Parents | Rs 20-40/signup |
| **Referral Program** | 15% | Existing users | Rs 30-50/referral |
| **Local Partnerships** | 10% | Schools, community centers | Variable |

### 6.3 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Target Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Calculation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **CAC (Student)** | Rs 100 | (Marketing Spend / New Students) |
| **LTV (Student)** | Rs 600+ | (Avg sessions × Commission × Months active) |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 6:1+ | Healthy ratio for sustainable growth |

**Example:**
- Average student books 4 sessions/month at Rs 300
- Platform commission: 15% = Rs 45/session × 4 = Rs 180/month
- Average retention: 6 months
- LTV = Rs 180 × 6 = Rs 1,080
- If CAC = Rs 100, LTV:CAC = 10.8:1 ✅ Excellent

### 6.4 Tutor Acquisition Strategy

Since tutors don't pay upfront:
1. **Free Signup**: Lower barrier to attract quality tutors
2. **Approval Process**: Maintain quality (as implemented)
3. **Value Proposition**: Highlight ready student base
4. **Commission Model**: They pay only when they earn

**Tutor Acquisition Channels:**
- LinkedIn targeting teaching professionals
- University job boards
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Teaching-focused Facebook groups

## Summary: The Winning Formula

### Who Pays?
**Students pay the platform directly**, ensuring:
- Revenue collection guaranteed
- Quality control maintained
- Trust built with parents
- Clear value exchange

### Your Commission Justification

You take 15% because you provide:

3. ✅ Marketing to recruit tutors (your investment)
4. ✅ Payment processing infrastructure
5. ✅ Quality assurance and vetting
6. ✅ Support and dispute resolution

### The Success Equation

```
Your Revenue = (Total Transactions × Commission Rate) + (Premium Subscriptions)

  ├── Acquire more tutors (supply)
  ├── Increase session prices (value)
  ├── Reduce churn (retention)
  └── Upsell premium features (monetization depth)
```

---

## Final Recommendation

**Implement the commission-based model where students pay the platform directly.**

This model:
1. **Protects your marketing investment** - Students can't bypass you after discovery
2. **Ensures tutor quality** - They earn based on performance
3. **Builds trust** - Parents know payments are protected
4. **Scales efficiently** - Revenue grows with volume
5. **Aligns incentives** - Everyone wins when sessions happen

Start with 15% commission, focus on delivering exceptional value, and adjust based on market feedback. Your investment in marketing creates the marketplace - your commission is the fair return on that investment.
