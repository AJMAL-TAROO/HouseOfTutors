# Super User Login Feature - Test Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the super user login feature for the House Of Tutors admin dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardAdmin.html
- **Line 34**: Modified the "House Of Tutors" navbar text to be clickable with `onclick="openSuperUserModal()"`
- **Lines 95-117**: Added Super User Login Modal HTML with:
  - Username input field
  - Password input field
  - Error message display (hidden by default)
  - Login and Cancel buttons
- **Lines 592-615**: Added three JavaScript functions:
  - `openSuperUserModal()`: Opens the modal and clears form fields
  - `closeSuperUserModal()`: Closes the modal
  - `verifySuperUser()`: Validates credentials (admin/admin123) and redirects to info.html

### 2. info.html (New File)
Created a new page that displays admin dashboard statistics:
- **Total Classrooms**: Count of all classrooms in the system
- **Total Students**: Count of all students in the system
- **Last Dashboard Load**: Timestamp of the most recent dashboard access
- **Recent Dashboard Loads Table**: Shows the last 10 dashboard loads with details

## Features Implemented

### Super User Authentication
- Credentials: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`
- Upon successful login, sets `superUserAuth` flag in localStorage
- Redirects to info.html page

### Info Page Security
- Checks for `superUserAuth` flag in localStorage
- If unauthorized, redirects back to DashboardAdmin.html
- Displays alert message for unauthorized access attempts

### Firebase Integration
The info.html page fetches data from Firebase:
- Retrieves classroom count from `CLASSROOMS` node
- Retrieves student count from `STUDENTS` node
- Retrieves and displays logs from `LOGS` node
- Shows last 10 dashboard load events in a table

## User Flow
1. Admin user is on DashboardAdmin.html
2. User clicks on "House Of Tutors" text in the navbar
3. Super User Login modal appears
4. User enters username: `admin` and password: `admin123`
5. User clicks "Login" button
6. System validates credentials
7. If valid, redirects to info.html
8. info.html displays dashboard statistics and logs

## Error Handling
- Invalid credentials show error message: "Invalid credentials!"
- Unauthorized access to info.html redirects to DashboardAdmin.html
- Console logging for debugging Firebase operations
- Graceful handling of missing data

## Testing Notes
The implementation has been verified for:
- Modal opening/closing functionality
- Credential validation
- Redirect behavior
- Firebase data fetching
- Responsive design
- Error handling
