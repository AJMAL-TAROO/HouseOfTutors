# Testing Admin Action Logs

This document describes how to test the newly implemented admin action logging features.

## Overview

The application now logs the following admin actions to Firebase under each admin's specific node:
- Last successful note upload (with classroom ID)
- Last successful classroom creation
- Last successful student creation
- Last VR classroom join click

All logs are stored under: `ADMIN/{adminKey}/LOGS/{logType}`

## Log Types and Structure

### 1. LAST_UPLOAD_NOTES
**Location**: `ADMIN/{adminKey}/LOGS/LAST_UPLOAD_NOTES`

  "DATE": "2024-10-11T20:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Test Steps**:
1. Login as an admin
2. Navigate to DashboardAdmin.html
3. Click on a classroom card and select "+" button to upload notes

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All log entries are stored under the correct admin's node (not globally)
- [ ] Logs contain all required fields (IDs, timestamps, dates, titles/names where applicable)
- [ ] Timestamps are in milliseconds since epoch
- [ ] Dates are in ISO 8601 format
- [ ] Each action updates only its specific log type (doesn't overwrite other logs)
- [ ] Logs are created/updated even if previous logs existed
- [ ] Different admins have separate log entries

## Firebase Database Structure Example

```
ADMIN/
  ADMIN_1/
    EMAIL: "admin1@example.com"
    FULL_NAME: "Admin One"
    VIRTUAL_ROOMS: "1001,1002"
    STUDENTS: "STUDENTS_12,STUDENTS_13"
    LOGS/
      LAST_UPLOAD_NOTES/
        CLASSROOM_ID: "1001"
        TIMESTAMP: 1728680400000
        DATE: "2024-10-11T20:00:00.000Z"
      LAST_CREATED_CLASSROOM/
        CLASSROOM_ID: 1002
        CLASSROOM_TITLE: "Math 101"
        TIMESTAMP: 1728680500000
        DATE: "2024-10-11T20:01:40.000Z"
      LAST_CREATED_STUDENT/
        STUDENT_ID: "STUDENTS_15"
        STUDENT_NAME: "John Doe"
        TIMESTAMP: 1728680600000
        DATE: "2024-10-11T20:03:20.000Z"
      LAST_JOINED_VR_CLASSROOM/
        CLASSROOM_ID: 1001
        CLASSROOM_TITLE: "Science 101"
        TIMESTAMP: 1728680700000
        DATE: "2024-10-11T20:05:00.000Z"
  ADMIN_2/
    EMAIL: "admin2@example.com"
    ...
```

## Notes

- Each admin's logs are independent and stored under their own admin key
- The logs track the LAST occurrence of each action, not a history of all occurrences
- Logs are automatically created on the first occurrence of each action
- Subsequent occurrences update the existing log entry
- The admin is identified by their email stored in localStorage
